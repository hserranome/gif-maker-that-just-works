# Summary

This is a simple web app that will allow users to upload images (png or jpeg) and will use them as frames to generate a gif. It will allow users to set up canvas size, image size, general frame speed, and individual frame duration.

Important points:

- Built using Preact (not React)
- Will probably need third party library to handle gif generation
